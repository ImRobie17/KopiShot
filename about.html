                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>In the heart of a war-torn land, General Lloyd Robie Tenorio found solace in a simple cup of coffee.
                     One fateful morning, as he sipped his brew amidst the chaos, a sniper's bullet whizzed past his ear, 
                     narrowly missing its target. Instead, the projectile pierced through his steaming mug, sending coffee 
                     splashing everywhere. Unfazed, General Tenorio chuckled at his near-death experience and the irony of a 
                     coffee cup saving his life.</p>

            <div class="row mb-5">
                <div class="col-md-6 order-md-2">

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 order-md-1 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">
                <p>Inspired by this extraordinary event, General Tenorio vowed to create a coffee shop upon his return home. He
                envisioned a place where people could escape the daily grind, find comfort, and share stories over a steaming 
                cup of joe. Joining him on this venture were his trusted comrades, Mark Justin Alzona and Angel Taac-Taac, 
                fellow soldiers who shared his passion for coffee and camaraderie.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column justify-content-center">
                    <p>After the war, the trio pooled their resources and opened the first Kopi Shot, a modest coffee shop 
                    named after the fateful shot that spared the general's life. They sourced the finest beans from local 
                    farmers, ensuring each cup was brewed to perfection. The shop quickly became a haven for veterans, 
                    locals, and tourists alike, drawn to its warm atmosphere and delicious coffee.</p>

                    <p>Kopi Shot's fame spread like wildfire, thanks to the general's captivating war stories and the shop's 
                    unique origin. People flocked from far and wide to experience the legendary "Sniper's Brew," a bold 
                    blend rumored to have life-saving properties. The coffee shop's success allowed them to expand rapidly, 
                    opening branches across the country and eventually, the world.</p>
